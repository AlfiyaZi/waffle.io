## Who Are We?

At Waffle.io, we're reinventing the way engineering teams track work. We believe developers shouldn't have to do extra work to update others on their status, so Waffle does it for them.

Waffle.io is an Enterprise Lean Startup, running inside one of largest independent software corporations in the world, CA Technologies. We believe in rapidly iterating on solutions with our customers, to find problems that are worth solving.

Are you passionate about improving the lives of developers like yourself? Do you thrive in a startup environment, where it’s up to you to solve a wide range of technical problems and work across the stack? If so, we’d love to meet you!

## Who Are You?

We’re looking for **craftswomen and craftsmen** who are **curious**, **creative**, **humble**, and are **empathetic**.

### Craftsmanship

We take pride in what we build. We focus on delivering the right thing to our customers, and we care deeply about quality. You’ll be a good fit on our team if you value writing tests, love seeing your work go to production with continuous deployments, and strive to make everything you touch just a little bit better when you leave it.

### Curiosity and Creativity

We are disciplined explorers, learning from our customers and trying new things to discover the future of the way engineering teams track work. We believe in the art of the possible. You’ll be a good fit on our team if you like saying [“yes, and”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Yes,_And%22_rule) to new ideas, but can also focus on what needs to get done.

### Humility

We value having a shared vision and coming together as a team to pursue it together. We each bring unique ideas to the table, and we’re excited when we’re able to work together to turn our ideas into something that’s better. You’ll fit in well if you can put aside your own awesomeness to make the team you work with stronger than any one individual.

### Empathy

We’re building a product that we ourselves use every day, and we know we need help from our customers to build the right thing. We value working with and understanding our customers. You’ll be a good fit on our team if you’re excited to meet Waffle’s customers and you’ll go above and beyond to make their day better.

## What’s It Like Working on Waffle.io?

### The Team

We’re a distributed team of four, with two in Boulder, CO and two in Raleigh, NC. For now we’re only accepting candidates who are willing to relocate to Boulder.

We run as a startup inside a big company. That means we do our own sales, marketing, devops, and of course product, development, and support. As an engineer, you’ll have a hand in everything.

### The Tech

Waffle.io runs on a NodeJS, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, MongoDB, and Docker stack. We’re hosted using cloud services, but also ship behind the firewall. We have a microservice architecture that’s continuously deployed.

### The Process

We use our own product to manage our work. Anyone in the world can see what we’re up to here: https://waffle.io/waffleio/waffle.io.
